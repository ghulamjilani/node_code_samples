# Full Stack Application (React + Node js)
## Backend: AdonisJS Folder Structure

The typical AdonisJS application has a clean structure to manage different components like routing, controllers, models, etc.

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ app/                    # Contains controllers, models, and services
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Controllers/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Middleware/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Models/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Services/

â”œâ”€â”€ config/                 # Configuration files for AdonisJS
â”œâ”€â”€ database/               # Database migrations, seeders, and factories

â”œâ”€â”€ tests/                  # Test files for the application
â”œâ”€â”€ uploads/                # Directory to store uploaded files
â”œâ”€â”€ ace.js                  # Adonis CLI entry file
â”œâ”€â”€ adonisrc.ts             # Adonis configuration file
â”œâ”€â”€ entrypoint.sh           # Shell script for container deployment
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json            # Dependencies and scripts
â”œâ”€â”€ tsconfig.json           # TypeScript configuration
â””â”€â”€ nuget.exe               # Executable file (possible for .NET or other dependencies)
```

â”œâ”€â”€ pages/                  # All the application pages
â”œâ”€â”€ routes/                 # Public and private routes configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ store/                  # Redux store and global state management
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/                  # Utility functions or constants
â”œâ”€â”€ App.css                 # Global styles for the app
â”œâ”€â”€ App.jsx                 # Main React component file
â”œâ”€â”€ index.css               # Global CSS
â””â”€â”€ main.jsx                # Application entry point
```

## Conclusion
This project integrates AdonisJS for the backend and React with Material UI for the frontend, creating a full-stack application with a clean and modular folder structure. The backend is designed to handle various functionalities such as authentication, dashboard management, and user interactions, while adhering to AdonisJS best practices. The frontend is built with React, using Material UI components and Redux for state management, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly interface.
